# # Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction - Week 2

This repository contains the continued development of the AQI prediction project, focusing on advanced modeling, evaluation, and analysis.

## Week 2 Progress

- Implemented multiple regression models for AQI prediction, including Linear Regression and other advanced techniques.
- Performed model training, validation, and comparison.
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, RÂ²).
- Analyzed feature importance to understand key drivers of AQI.
- Enhanced data preprocessing and feature engineering steps.
- Documented code and results for reproducibility.

## Instructions

1. Ensure `city_day.csv` is present in the project directory.
2. Open any of the provided notebooks in Jupyter, VS Code, or Google Colab.
3. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Import libraries
   - Load and preprocess the dataset
   - Train and evaluate models
   - Analyze results and feature importance

## Notes

- All preprocessing steps are included in the notebooks.
- Model comparison and analysis are documented for clarity.
- No missing value imputation is required for this dataset.
